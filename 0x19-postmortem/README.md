Postmortem
Postmortem: Website Outage on August 1, 2024
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage: August 1, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 UTC
Impact: The companyâ€™s main website and client portal were down, preventing users from accessing their accounts and new users from signing up. Approximately 80% of the users experienced complete service disruption, while 20% experienced severe slowness.
Root Cause: Misconfiguration of the load balancer after a routine maintenance update.
Timeline
14:00: Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating high error rates.
14:05: On-call engineer notified via pager.
14:10: Initial investigation began focusing on application servers due to error logs.
14:30: Identified increased CPU usage on application servers; assumed it was a server-side issue.
15:00: Misleading path: restarted application servers, but the issue persisted.
15:15: Escalated to the network team after ruling out application server issues.
15:30: Network team identified load balancer configuration changes coinciding with the outage.
15:45: Rolled back load balancer configuration to pre-maintenance state.
16:00: Services began to recover; monitoring confirmed the drop in error rates.
16:30: Full service restoration verified.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The load balancer configuration was updated during routine maintenance to improve traffic distribution efficiency. However, the new configuration inadvertently caused a mismatch in routing rules, leading to traffic not being properly directed to the backend servers. This resulted in users receiving errors or experiencing significant delays.
Resolution: Once the network team identified the misconfiguration, the load balancer settings were rolled back to the previous, stable configuration. This immediately restored proper traffic routing, and normal service was resumed. Additional verification was done to ensure all services were operational and performing optimally.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:
Load Balancer Configuration: Implement stricter review and testing processes for load balancer changes.
Monitoring Enhancements: Add specific alerts for load balancer health and configuration discrepancies.
Documentation: Improve documentation on load balancer configurations and rollback procedures.
Tasks:
Patch Load Balancer: Update to the latest stable version with known bug fixes.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement detailed monitoring for load balancer performance and error rates.
Configuration Management: Introduce a more rigorous configuration management system with automated validation.
Training: Conduct training sessions for network and application teams on best practices for load balancer configuration and incident response.
Incident Review: Schedule a review meeting to discuss the incident, lessons learned, and improvements.
